 Checkers UI
 -----------
 
 * Make event-based in case coder uses internal game structure to play
 * Be sure no 'game' objects can throw NullReferenceException in public functions
 * Allow clickable movements; instead of dragable movements
 * Hide 'jumped' in the process of a double-jump
 * Show last move
 * Show more subtle 'Must jump' message (Option)
 * Property: 'Text' -- shows text on the board (using ForeColor)
 * Property: 'TextAlign'
 * Stalemates (through game)
 x With optional jumping, if double-jump is available keep going .. if piece is placed on same spot, end turn
 - Smooth animations (Option)
 
 Checkers Game
 -------------
 
 * Remember last CheckersPiece that moved: LastMoved
 * Stalemates
 x Make game able to play with optional jumping
